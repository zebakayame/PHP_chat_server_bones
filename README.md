# PHP CHAT SERVER BONES

The bones of the bones with a sweet little bit of tendons and single string muscle with the css and bla bla

Anyway, this shit is just some kind of template things that function with php, sql and so on

This project is shit, it ask the entire sql message table every 500ms meaning it take a lot of request in the server side

Need to be improved but idc about it

Feel free to do whatever u want with it, not that this shit can take you in a long run...

The only thing u are not free to use as you want is:

All the assets (image). That's not yours

And the Website design. I designed the look of the website so please design it on your own way and don't copy me, that's mine grrrr

Anyway, UwU
